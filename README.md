# dipstick
A quick, modular metrics toolkit for Rust applications of all types. Similar to popular logging frameworks,
but with counters, markers, gauges and timers.

Dipstick's main attraction is the ability to send metrics to multiple customized outputs.
For example, metrics could be written immediately to the log _and_ 
sent over the network after a period of aggregation.

Dipstick promotes structured metrics for clean, safe code and good performance.
 
Dipstick builds on stable Rust with minimal dependencies. 

## Features

  - Send metrics to stdout, log, statsd or graphite (one or many)
  - Synchronous, asynchronous or mixed operation
  - Optional fast random statistical sampling
  - Immediate propagation or local aggregation of metrics (count, sum, average, min/max)
  - Periodic or programmatic publication of aggregated metrics
  - Customizable output statistics and formatting
  - Global or scoped (e.g. per request) metrics
  - Per-application and per-output metric namespaces
   
## Examples

For complete applications see the [examples](https://github.com/fralalonde/dipstick/tree/master/examples).

To use Dipstick in your project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml`
in the `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
dipstick = "0.6.5"
```

Then add it to your code:

```rust,skt-fail,no_run
let metrics = metrics(to_graphite("host.com:2003")?);
let counter = metrics.counter("my_counter");
counter.count(3);
```

Send metrics to multiple outputs:

```rust,skt-fail,no_run
let _app_metrics = metrics((
        to_stdout(), 
        to_statsd("localhost:8125")?.with_namespace(&["my", "app"])
    ));
```
Since instruments are decoupled from the backend, outputs can be swapped easily.

Aggregate metrics and schedule to be periodical publication in the background:
```rust,skt-run
use std::time::Duration;

let app_metrics = metrics(aggregate(all_stats, to_stdout()));
app_metrics.flush_every(Duration::from_secs(3));
```

Aggregation is performed locklessly and is very fast.
Count, sum, min, max and average are tracked where they make sense.
Published statistics can be selected with presets such as `all_stats` (see previous example),
`summary`, `average`.

For more control over published statistics, provide your own strategy:
```rust,skt-run
metrics(aggregate(
    |_kind, name, score|
        match score {
            ScoreType::Count(count) => 
                Some((Kind::Counter, vec![name, ".per_thousand"], count / 1000)),
            _ => None
        },
    to_log()));
```

Apply statistical sampling to metrics:
```rust,skt-fail
let _app_metrics = metrics(to_statsd("server:8125")?.with_sampling_rate(0.01));
```
A fast random algorithm is used to pick samples.
Outputs can use sample rate to expand or format published data.

Metrics can be recorded asynchronously:
```rust,skt-run
let _app_metrics = metrics(to_stdout().with_async_queue(64));
```
The async queue uses a Rust channel and a standalone thread.
The current behavior is to block when full.

For speed and easier maintenance, metrics are usually defined statically:
```rust,skt-plain
#[macro_use] extern crate dipstick;
#[macro_use] extern crate lazy_static;
use dipstick::*;

metrics!("my_app" => {
    @Counter COUNTER_A: "counter_a";
});

fn main() {
    send_metrics(to_stdout());
    COUNTER_A.count(11);
}
```
Metric definition macros are just `lazy_static!` wrappers.


Where necessary, metrics can be defined _ad-hoc_:
```rust,skt-run
let user_name = "john_day";
let app_metrics = metrics(to_log()).with_cache(512);
app_metrics.gauge(format!("gauge_for_user_{}", user_name)).value(44);
```
Defining a cache is optional but will speed up re-definition of common ad-hoc metrics.

Timers can be used multiple ways:
```rust,skt-run
let app_metrics = metrics(to_stdout());
let timer =  app_metrics.timer("my_timer");
time!(timer, {/* slow code here */} );
timer.time(|| {/* slow code here */} );

let start = timer.start();
/* slow code here */
timer.stop(start);

timer.interval_us(123_456);
```

Related metrics can share a namespace:
```rust,skt-run
let app_metrics = metrics(to_stdout());
let db_metrics = app_metrics.with_prefix("database");
let _db_timer = db_metrics.timer("db_timer");
let _db_counter = db_metrics.counter("db_counter");
```
